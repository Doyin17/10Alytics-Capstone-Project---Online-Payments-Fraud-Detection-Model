# 10Alytics Capstone Project- Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning


Problem Definition: This project is aimed at building a Machine Learning model that can predict the frequency of fraudulent activities entailed in the online payment transactions of Blossom Bank. This is a huge issue for Bloom Bank due to the magnitude of online transactions, as fraudulent transactions can bring about monetary misfortunes and harm to its standing.

Data Source: 10Alytics

IDE: Jupiter Notebook.

Purpose of Analysis: How might the business profit from this undertaking? By utilizing Machine Learning to foster a prediction model for distinguishing fraudulent transactions, Bloom Bank Plc might possibly reduce their misfortunes from online fraudulent transactions. This can be accomplished by signaling possible fraudulent transactions and putting measures in place to forestall them. Also, by deploying Machine Learning to indicate the intricate factors of most online payment fraud, Blossom Bank Plc can better understand the trends and tactics used by fraudsters and put measures in place to prevent future incidents.
Generally, the solution provided by the Online Payment Fraud Detection Machine Learning Project can help Blossom Bank Plc to reduce their exposure to online payment fraud and protect their monetary assets and reputation.

Imported Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn.

Analysis Steps: Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Preprocessing, Scaling, Splitting of Datasets, Model building, evaluation, and Confusion matrix analysis.

Trained Models: Logistics Regression Model, Gaussian Model, Random Forest Model.

The output of the classification and the Confusion matrix was used to evaluate the accuracy of the model which makes the Random Forest model most ideal for our dataset with focus on the false positive value.
